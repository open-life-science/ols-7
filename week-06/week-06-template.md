15 minutes, ~3-4/room: we will have some written discussion and some spoken discussion room



#### Discussion prompts for the room:

   * Do you think scientific research is open?
   * If yes,
       * How is it open?
       * Why do you call it open?
   * If you wouldn’t call it open,
       * Why not?
       * Can we then call it “closed” science? 
       * If applicable, include a comment on who is inside that closeted science and who is out, or who belongs and who doesn’t
           * Think of what group you belong to.
